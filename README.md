# Discrete Optimisation

#### Overview
When starting to learn python I first tackled the Coursera course Discrete Optimsation, which teaches heuristics for solving NP-hard combinatorial problems. I was just starting to code at this point so my approaches are somewhat hard-to-follow and wacky, but at the time I was happy to just have working code. If I were to re-do these problems now I would like to try to apply what I've learned from Algorithms I to make these solutions more readable and elegant. Every time I open these files I itch to do some re-factoring.
