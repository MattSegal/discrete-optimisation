# 8 Queens

#### Overview
This script finds a way to position 8 queens on a chessboard with none of them able to attack any other queen.
It uses a constraint solver to reduce the size of the search space by removing all possible choices the violate the problem's constraints.

Run queens.py to use the script.

#### Possible Future Work
* Remove the backtracking search style and instead use a more efficient form of graph based search to navigate the search space. 
* Improve code readability
* Make it possible for a user to select the placement of the first queen.
